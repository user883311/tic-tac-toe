# tic-tac-toe
a freecodecamp project


Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

User Story: 
- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

First time that I had to design a game where the computer does not behave randomly, but efficiently.

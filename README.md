# tic-tac-toe
## a freecodecamp project

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

User Story: 
- Before game starts, the computer plays against itself in the background.
- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- My game resets as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

The virtual computer player behaves according to hard-coded optimal rules, as found in Crowley and Spiegler in (1993). 

Designed mobile-first and responsive.
